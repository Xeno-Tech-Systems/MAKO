# Mako3D — 3D rendering

```mako
using Mako3D;

main() {
    Mako3D.init(800, 600, "3D");
    Mako3D.fps(60);
    cam = Mako3D.camera(10, 8, 10,  0, 0, 0);   # position, target

    while Mako3D.running() {
        Mako3D.update_camera(cam, 8);           # WASD + mouse controls

        Mako3D.begin();
        Mako3D.clear(Mako3D.color(18, 18, 28));

        Mako3D.begin_3d(cam);
        Mako3D.grid(20, 1);
        Mako3D.cube(0, 1, 0,  2, 2, 2,  Mako3D.RED);
        Mako3D.end_3d();

        Mako3D.text("HUD text draws after end_3d", 10, 10, 18, Mako3D.WHITE);
        Mako3D.end();
    }
    Mako3D.close();
}
```

Lifecycle (`init fps running begin end close delta get_fps width height
title draw_fps`) and colors (`color`, `fade`, 21 named constants) work
exactly like [Mako2D](mako2d.md).

Windows are resizable by default. Use `resized()` to react to a size change,
`width()` / `height()` for the live dimensions, and `min_size(w, h)` for a
minimum. `init(800, 600, "Game", false)` creates a fixed-size window.

`clear(color)` fills the frame before drawing, same as Mako2D. `sky(color)`
is an alias for the same call, named for when you're filling a 3D scene's
backdrop rather than a 2D canvas — the two are interchangeable:

```mako
Mako3D.begin();
Mako3D.sky(Mako3D.color(135, 206, 235));  # same effect as Mako3D.clear(...)
```

## Camera3D

| Function | Description |
|---|---|
| `camera(px, py, pz, tx, ty, tz, fov=45)` | Create → handle |
| `update_camera(cam, speed=5)` | **Interactive controls in one call:** WASD/arrows fly, Q/E up/down, middle-mouse drag orbits, scroll zooms |
| `move_camera(cam, px, py, pz, tx, ty, tz)` | Set position + target directly (camera-follow) |
| `orbit_camera(cam, angle_deg, distance, height)` | Circle around the target |
| `camera_pos(cam)` | `[x, y, z]` — feed this to positional audio as the listener |

Everything between `begin_3d(cam)` and `end_3d()` renders in 3D; text and
2D shapes drawn after `end_3d()` become the HUD.

## Primitives

| Function | Description |
|---|---|
| `cube(x,y,z, w,h,d, color)` | Cube with black wireframe |
| `cube_raw(...)` | Cube without wireframe |
| `wire_cube(x,y,z, w,h,d, color)` | Outline only, no filled faces — selection highlights, debug bounds |
| `sphere(x,y,z, r, color)` / `sphere_raw(...)` | Sphere |
| `cylinder(x,y,z, r_top, r_bottom, height, color)` | Cylinder |
| `plane(x,y,z, width, depth, color)` | Flat ground plane |
| `grid(slices, spacing)` | Reference grid at y=0 |
| `line3d(x1,y1,z1, x2,y2,z2, color)` | 3D line — great for debug rays/paths |
| `point3d(x,y,z, color)` | Single point |

## Models

For normal games, the v1.1 [`Models`](models.md) package is shorter and keeps
readable names: `Models.load("hero", "hero.glb")` then
`Models.draw("hero", x, y, z)`. The handle API below remains available for
advanced code.

| Function | Description |
|---|---|
| `load_model(path)` | Load `.obj` / `.glb` → handle |
| `draw_model(model, x, y, z, scale, color)` | Draw it |

## Scene / objects

The primitives above are immediate-mode — draw calls you repeat every
frame. For anything you don't want to hand-redraw each frame (props, a
level's static geometry, enemies), spawn it once and let `draw_scene()`
draw everything that's still registered:

```mako
cube = Mako3D.spawn_cube(0, 1, 0,  2, 2, 2, Mako3D.RED);
Mako3D.spawn_plane(0, 0, 0,  20, 20, Mako3D.DARKGRAY);

while Mako3D.running() {
    Mako3D.set_object_rotation(cube, t * 40);   # mutate by handle, any frame

    Mako3D.begin(); Mako3D.clear(Mako3D.BLACK);
    Mako3D.begin_3d(cam);
    Mako3D.draw_scene();                         # draws every spawned object
    Mako3D.end_3d();
    Mako3D.end();
}
```

| Function | Description |
|---|---|
| `spawn_cube(x,y,z, w,h,d, color)` | → handle |
| `spawn_sphere(x,y,z, r, color)` | → handle |
| `spawn_cylinder(x,y,z, r_top, r_bottom, height, color)` | → handle |
| `spawn_plane(x,y,z, width, depth, color)` | → handle |
| `set_object_pos(h, x, y, z)` | Move it |
| `set_object_color(h, color)` | Recolor it |
| `set_object_scale(h, x, y, z)` | Resize it (meaning depends on shape — see below) |
| `set_object_rotation(h, degrees)` | Rotate around the Y axis (v1 — Y-axis only) |
| `set_object_visible(h, bool)` | Hide/show without removing |
| `set_object_wires(h, bool)` | Toggle the black wireframe outline |
| `set_object_name(h, name)` | Label it — purely cosmetic, doesn't need to be unique |
| `find_object(name)` | → the handle of the first object with this exact name, or `none` |
| `remove_object(h)` | Remove permanently |
| `clear_objects()` | Remove everything |
| `object_count()` | How many are currently registered |
| `object_bounds(h)` | `[min_x,min_y,min_z, max_x,max_y,max_z]` — an axis-aligned box for collision, or `none` if removed |
| `object_info(h)` | Dict with `shape,name,x,y,z,sx,sy,sz,rotation,color,visible,wires` — the read side of `set_object_*()`, or `none` if removed |
| `draw_scene()` | Draw every visible spawned object — call between `begin_3d()`/`end_3d()` |
| `save_scene(path="scene.json")` | Write every spawned object to a JSON file |
| `load_scene(path)` | Clear the scene and respawn everything from a saved file |

`set_object_scale`'s three numbers mean different things per shape:
cube = width/height/depth, sphere = radius (first number only), cylinder =
radius_top/radius_bottom/height, plane = width/(unused)/depth.

Spawning, mutating, removing, counting, and save/load are all pure data
operations — they work even before a window is open, so they're fully
unit-testable (see `tests/mako3d_scene.mko`). Only `draw_scene()` needs an
active `begin_3d()` context.

`load_scene()` reassigns handles in file order — any handles you held
before the call (including a current selection) are no longer valid, so
drop them (e.g. `selected = none`) after loading.

Collision helpers for 3D scenes:

```mako
dist3d(x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2)                          # 3D distance
box3d_overlap(min1x,min1y,min1z, max1x,max1y,max1z,      # two AABBs —
              min2x,min2y,min2z, max2x,max2y,max2z)      # object_bounds()'s own format
```

### Picking (click-to-select)

```mako
selected = Mako3D.pick_object(cam);   # under the current mouse position
Mako3D.pick_object(cam, screen_x, screen_y);   # or an explicit point
```

Casts a ray from the camera through the given screen point (or the mouse,
by default) and returns the handle of the closest visible object it hits —
or `none` if nothing was under it. Ray/AABB test against `object_bounds()`,
so it ignores rotation the same way bounds do, and skips hidden objects.

```mako
# Guard with MakoUI.wants_mouse() if MakoUI is embedded in the same window,
# so clicking a panel doesn't also select an object underneath it.
if Inputs.mouse_pressed("left") and not MakoUI.wants_mouse() {
    selected = Mako3D.pick_object(cam);
}

if selected != none {
    b = Mako3D.object_bounds(selected);
    if b == none {
        selected = none;   # it was removed since being picked
    } else {
        cx = (b[0]+b[3])/2; cy = (b[1]+b[4])/2; cz = (b[2]+b[5])/2;
        Mako3D.wire_cube(cx, cy, cz,  b[3]-b[0]+0.1, b[4]-b[1]+0.1, b[5]-b[2]+0.1, Mako3D.GOLD);
    }
}
```

That pattern — pick on click, draw a `wire_cube` around the current bounds
each frame, drop the selection if `object_bounds()` comes back `none` — is
the whole click-to-select loop. Pair it with `object_info(handle)` (the read
side of `set_object_*()` — shape, position, scale, rotation, color,
visibility, wireframe, all in one dict) to build a live editor: read the
current values into sliders, write any change straight back with
`set_object_*()`. See `examples/scene_demo.mko` for the picking loop and
`examples/embedded_ui_demo.mko`'s "Selected" tab for the full live-edit
pattern with MakoUI.

See `examples/scene_demo.mko` for a scene with dozens of objects, a
rotating handle-driven pillar, runtime removal, and click-to-select.

### Mesh edit mode (vertices, edges, faces)

Object Mode above selects a whole object. This is the Blender-style step
inside it — look at (and select) the object's actual geometry, generated
fresh from its current shape and scale:

```mako
info = Mako3D.mesh_info(handle);      # {vertex_count, edge_count, face_count}
verts = Mako3D.mesh_vertices(handle); # [[x,y,z], ...] — world space
edges = Mako3D.mesh_edges(handle);    # [[x1,y1,z1, x2,y2,z2], ...]
faces = Mako3D.mesh_faces(handle);    # [[x1,y1,z1, x2,y2,z2, x3,y3,z3], ...]

Mako3D.draw_vertices(handle, Mako3D.YELLOW, 0.06);  # a small sphere per vertex
Mako3D.draw_edges(handle, Mako3D.YELLOW);           # every edge as a line

vi = Mako3D.pick_vertex(cam, handle);  # nearest vertex to the mouse, or none
                                        # if nothing is within ~14 screen pixels
fi = Mako3D.pick_face(cam, handle);    # the triangle the mouse ray actually
                                        # hits (nearest, if several), or none
```

| Function | Description |
|---|---|
| `mesh_info(h)` | `{vertex_count, edge_count, face_count}`, or `none` |
| `mesh_vertices(h)` | Unique vertex positions, world space |
| `mesh_edges(h)` | Unique edges, as endpoint pairs |
| `mesh_faces(h)` | Triangles, as three corners each |
| `draw_vertices(h, color, size=0.06)` | Small spheres at every vertex |
| `draw_edges(h, color)` | Every edge as a line (independent of `set_object_wires`) |
| `pick_vertex(cam, h, max_pixels=14)` | Index into `mesh_vertices()` nearest the mouse, or `none` |
| `pick_face(cam, h)` | Index into `mesh_faces()` the mouse ray hits, or `none` |

Vertices/edges/faces come from geometry generated fresh, in plain math, on
every call, from the object's *current* shape and scale — not from raylib's
own mesh generator, which uploads straight to the GPU and would crash
without an open window. That keeps this headlessly testable like the rest
of the object system (see `tests/mako3d_scene.mko`), and cheap enough for
editor use, though not meant to be called every frame for hundreds of
objects at once. A cube reports exactly 8 vertices, 12 edges, and 12 faces
— edges come from each shape's own quads, not derived generically from
triangle pairs, so a face's triangulation diagonal never shows up as a
phantom edge. This is selection/inspection only — there's no dragging
geometry (moving individual vertices) yet; rotation is also ignored, same
as `object_bounds()`.

## Input extras

Mirrors of the [Inputs package](inputs.md) plus `mouse_delta_x()` /
`mouse_delta_y()` and `hide_cursor()` / `show_cursor()` for mouse-look.
# Skyboxes

Load a 4×3 cross-layout cubemap once, then draw it first inside the 3D pass:

```mako
skybox = Mako3D.create_skybox("Images/Skybox.png");

Mako3D.begin_3d(camera);
Mako3D.draw_skybox(skybox);
# Draw the rest of the scene here.
Mako3D.end_3d();
```

Skybox paths resolve relative to the running script. A missing image uses a
small fallback sky instead of crashing.
